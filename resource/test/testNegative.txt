a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick .

i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best .
has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all .
 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat .
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though .

a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .

the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .
madonna still can't act a lick .
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
don't let your festive spirit go this far .
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .

mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
the movie gets muted and routine .
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna .

propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition � wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text � when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
a very average science fiction film .
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .

static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image .
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .

as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

 . . . has virtually no script at all . . .
will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away .
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster .
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
most of the action setups are incoherent .
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .

a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes .

the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life .
all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .
only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble .
[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
